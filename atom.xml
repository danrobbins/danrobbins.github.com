      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every market day, I receive an email from <a href="http://www.barchart.com">barchart.com</a> with their chart of the day. It features a stock making a new high, which by definition, is a stock in a upward trend of course. In the introductory paragraph of the email, it said:</p>

<blockquote><p>The &#8220;Chart of the Day&#8221; is ResMed (RMD), which showed up on Tuesday&#8217;s Barchart &#8220;All-Time High&#8221; list. ResMed on Tuesday posted a new all-time high of $43.48 and closed +1.07%. TrendSpotter has been long since Dec 11 at $42.08. In recent news on the stock, ResMed on Oct 25 reported fiscal Q1 EPS of 49 cents, above the consensus of 46 cents. ResMed, with a market cap of $6 billion, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating and diagnosing sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disordered breathing includes sleep apnea and related respiratory conditions.</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought, &#8220;hey, I know this company, they make the CPAP machine I use.&#8221; Back in late 2007, I complained to my doctor about a variety of symptoms and he indicated that a sleep study was a wise course of action. I went to a sleep center, got hooked up to a bunch of sensors and had an awful night&#8217;s sleep. Upon leaving, I saw my technician who said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be seeing you back soon Mr. Robbins!&#8221; Sure enough, I was called back for a follow-up night to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure">CPAP machine</a> and again hooked up to the sensors to measure for improvement. Boy did I have a great night sleep using the machine - sure I bit uncomfortable not being used to wearing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Full_face_cpap_mask.jpg">jet fighter looking mask</a> but I wanted to take the machine home with me! I met with the sleep doctor soon after to find out my results. Without the CPAP machine, I suffered from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea">sleep apnea</a> and averaged an apnea event every other minute. The doctor said that was like someone taping my shoulder that frequently, so of course I wasn&#8217;t sleeping well. Of more serious concern with sleep apnea, is pauses in breathing, which caused, In my case, my oxygen saturation to drop dangerously close to the level that can induce a cardiac event. (Note: see your doctor if you think you might be at risk - this is serious stuff).</p>

<p>So to wrap up my story, in January 2008, I received my CPAP unit and having been using it ever since. I travel with it and I even take a battery pack when camping. Remember, <a href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/knowledge-center/infographic/sleep-more-be-awesome">sleep is awesome!</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lynch">Peter Lynch?</a> Right, back to that. So he wrote a book after his time at the helm of the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund, called &#8220;One up on Wall Street.&#8221; In a nutshell, a major premise is that individuals can do better than Wall Street by investing in companies they experience around them. New store opening up that you like? Stayed at a hotel you really enjoyed? Bought a great device? etc&#8230; These are opportunities to invest in companies that may be growing, but under the radar of financial analysts and traders.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the weekly chart of ResMed <a href="http://stocktwits.com/symbol/RMD">$RMD</a> since January 2008 when I first became aware of the company. Certainly the stock has done well in the 4 years overall but there were two prime trends that offered the most opportunity. See my notes in the chart. Furthermore, nice quarterly earnings growth too: <a href="http://ycharts.com/companies/RMD/eps_growth">Ycharts</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write a post in the near future about this in the near future, but remember this: <em>you can&#8217;t backtest your brain.</em> Anybody can look at a historical chart and point out the best buy and sell points (as I did here) but that doesn&#8217;t make you money. It&#8217;s how you respond to the current chart situation and overall environment and manage the trade that does. I could have thought in 2008, &#8220;interesting company, their product really helps me, I wonder if they&#8217;re publicly traded?&#8221; That would have been my Peter Lynch moment for this stock. Sure, the right time to buy wasn&#8217;t until almost 18 months afterwards but it all starts with the idea.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4><em>Or, How a non-hacker set-up a &#8220;blogging framework for hackers&#8221;</em></h4>

<p>In starting this site, I had a few objectives besides posting about the markets. I got my first internet account in 1995, and it came with a whopping one megabyte of &#8220;personal web space.&#8221; I thought about what to do with that, as I wanted to learn how to make a web page but didn&#8217;t know what to put on it. My roommate at the time, suggested, &#8220;How about your margarita recipe?&#8221; Bingo, that was it. I learned how to code html and put up my website, titled, &#8220;Spike&#8217;s World Famous Margaritas&#8221; and to borrow the term, I built it and people came, mostly through the Yahoo directory of the time, and by people sharing links. I had a guestbook on the site, coded in Perl and would get several entries a week, which was awesome. The url was ugly, like http://www.deltanet.com/~users/spike/margarita.htm as it was provided by the internet provider. 5 years later in 2000, I finally made a permanent home for my site at <a href="http://www.blenderking.com">blenderking.com</a>. The switchover was part of a project to teach myself Cold Fusion, and I loved what I learned about creating a database driven website, but that will be another post. I later switched to Wordpress after kids sucked up my coding time.</p>

<p>For this new website, my objectives were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn more about cloud computing, using Amazon Web Services and EC2 as a reference point</li>
<li>Learn more about the command line and working with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
<li>I wanted another avenue for writing</li>
<li>Get back into learning programming, modifying code, as well as learn <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a></li>
<li>Create a separate website for market oriented postings</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I found <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> to be exactly what I wanted. I first encountered via <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s site</a>. The default design is great, and as I learned more, I was intrigued by the prospect of creating my own site based on it.</p>

<h4>Why I went with Amazon EC2, with a dash of Dropbox mixed in</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>Interestingly, I&#8217;ve found it to be common for most of the people running Octopress to write a post how their individual setup and configuration. Most generate the site on a Mac, then push the html pages to a webhost. After struggling a bit with setting up SSH and Git properly on my Mac, I decided this was the opportunity to use Amazon EC2 as a learning opportunity. I&#8217;m glad I did! But it came with a learning curve to do it the way I wanted to. Here&#8217;s my general process for writing a post:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type the post on my Mac using TextMate</li>
<li>Save it to specific folder inside of <a href="http://db.tt/aTciVolG">Dropbox</a></li>
<li>Go to the AWS console, start up my micro EC2 instance</li>
<li>Once the instance is running, generate the site and copy it to the Apache htdocs folder for testing on the server</li>
<li>Edit, re-generate, and test if neccessary</li>
<li>Deploy the site to my host, in this case, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github pages</a> but I&#8217;m also set up to deploy to Amazon S3. It&#8217;s just a configuration and DNS change to switch.</li>
<li>Turn off the EC2 instance. If I&#8217;m within 1 hour, I spent 2 cents to generate and deploy the site.</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, 2 cents an hour. That&#8217;s how much I pay to rent a Linux server via Amazon. In my mind, that&#8217;s utterly amazing. Quick math - if I write 10 posts a month, that&#8217;s 20 cents a month to rent the server. (Plus monthly EBS volume changes, which for my use is about a dollar/month). In time, I might find that generating the site takes longer. If I wanted to, I&#8217;d have the option to migrate to a larger instance. For example, a Medium High CPU instance is 16.5 cents an hour. The same 10 posts a month would cost $1.65. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">Here&#8217;s the EC2 pricing</a>. Amazing.</p>

<h4>Major Advantage - this seemingly convoluted setup is iPad friendly!</h4>

<p>I structured it this way so I could create posts from my iPad (and an iPhone too if I really wanted to). All the ingredients are there:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can turn on and off the EC2 instance via Amazon&#8217;s web based console</li>
<li><a href="http://db.tt/aTciVolG">Dropbox</a> is installed on the EC2 instance with it symlinked to my octopress/source/_posts folder</li>
<li>I create/edit posts on the iPad using <a href="http://nebulousapps.net">Nebulous Notes</a></li>
<li>I connect to the EC2 command line, for generating and deploying the site via <a href="http://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a></li>
<li>Keep in mind the IP address of the EC2 instance changes with every restart. You could, optionally, create an elastic IP address in AWS, which costs 1/2 cent per hour when the instance is not running</li>
<li>I set up aliases in my EC2 bash profile to save keystrokes. Prompt also provides auto-completion of prior used commands.</li>
</ul>


<p>Furthermore, Nebulous Notes has macro ability; I was able to create a template of the YAML front matter for the Octopress post, saving on typing when creating a post on the iPad. The <a href="http://db.tt/aTciVolG">Dropbox</a> setup works perfectly - I can create a post on my Mac and continue editing it on my iPad, and vice-versa (as I did in creating this lengthy post) Furthermore, I also have a folder for images that is symlinked between Dropbox and Octopress too.</p>

<h4>How I got the site up and running:</h4>

<ul>
<li>I Used <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/rubystack">Bitnami Rubystack</a> - this made things so easy. A few clicks and I had all the software installed in my EC2 instance. Ruby, GIT, Apache, etc. No muss, no fuss</li>
<li>Installed Octopress from Git, from my own fork. (note - had to sudo some commands, i.e. bundler)</li>
<li>Setup ssh to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-linux">Github</a></li>
<li>Setup <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> for command line access to Amazon S3. This <a href="http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2011/08/20/quick-tip-for-easily-deploying-octopress-blog-on-amazon-s3/">site was helpful</a>. Note, I found it worked better to paste the keys in, not type them in.</li>
<li>Setup <a href="http://db.tt/aTciVolG">Dropbox</a>. This <a href="http://buildcontext.com/blog/2012/dropbox-linux-ubuntu-ec2-linode-selective-sync">site&#8217;s</a> instructions made things easy.</li>
<li>Configured the site to my needs; the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/">Octopress docs</a> cover a lot, or do some searching. I also found it helpful to search Twitter for any mention of Octopress.</li>
<li>Oh, and actually write some posts, that&#8217;s the whole point, right?</li>
</ul>


<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>I really enjoyed setting the site up. I learned what I set out to learn and am very pleased with how the site looks. Also, with my setup, it&#8217;s super cheap to run. Sure, it would be free if I used my mac and github but my expense is minimal. I&#8217;m thankful for the community around Octopress - I learned from so many people who had posted their setups. I&#8217;m still learning about VIM and the command line but feel much more comfortable already. I think I&#8217;d like to set up my own theme as a way of re-learning CSS and design.</p>

<p><em>Ultimately, the site is about the content</em>, and I&#8217;m using this site as a platform to post charts and my general thoughts on the markets. So I&#8217;ve combined two hobbies into one!</p>
