<div class="entry-content"><p>Quick update until the weekend. It&#8217;s still all bullish, though any decent oscillator type thingy will look over-valued right now. Over-valued isn&#8217;t a reason to sell, just not a place to increase aggressiveness. I like using <a href="http://www.stockcharts.com">stockcharts&#8217;</a> bullish percent indicators - I&#8217;m not into point and figure charts myself, but the aggregate charts they produce are nice and clean for intermediate trends. <a href="http://stockcharts.com/symsearch/index.html?%24bp">This is a a search at stockcharts.com </a> that lists, mainly at the top, the bullish percent indexes they offer. Not all useful, but check them out.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the chart I reviewed tonight, if you&#8217;re not a member of the site, you won&#8217;t be able to re-create the chart for yourself exactly.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s super easy to look at a chart and pick out the buy and sell points. The question in trading/investing is what you use to make these decisions and how to manage the position while active. The chart is nothing more than historical facts. The rest is what we, as humans, wish to apply on top of it. Those things we apply on top may be</p>

<ul>
<li>derivatives of the historical prices (i.e. moving averages, MACD, RSI, stochastics, etc.) or</li>
<li>our interpretations of all the lines and squiggles</li>
</ul>


<p>Take a look at all the different indicators (studies) provided by <a href="http://team.thinkorswim.com/manual/dark/studies/studies%20library/index.html">thinkorswim</a>. I counted 273 studies, and it grows with each release. On top of that, you can write your own studies using their thinkscript language, or obtain custom studies through sites like <a href="http://www.thinkscripter.com">thinkscripter</a>. Wow - so much choice! Each different indicator written by somebody who codified a theory into lines or arrows - and made the workings available (usually) to the public. Since I&#8217;ve gotten more involved in the markets over the past 6 years, I&#8217;ve seen many, many different types of charts posted by others or those I&#8217;ve experimented on my own. Tick charts, range charts, Charts with 10 or more indicators. Check out the swami and thermo charts available on thinkorswim <a href="http://mediaserver.thinkorswim.com/notices/Release_032412.html">here</a> Ouch - how does one make decisions from that?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not here to bash convoluted charts or the use of indicators. I use indicators, but I can explain each one I use in under a minute. But if you&#8217;re looking for a crutch, or to remove yourself from decision making (i.e. &#8220;stupid HFT traders cost me money&#8221;) then you&#8217;re not using them as intended. I&#8217;ve read lots and lots of market related books, financial blogs, followed traders on twitter and the most basic repeatable lesson I&#8217;ve learned is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a method to determine the trend</li>
<li>Trade within that trend</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, easy to write, and difficult to carry out for many, myself included too sometimes. Why? Because we let our brains mess with that basic formula of trading within the trend. We let news, opinion, tips, contrary opinion, etc. cloud our judgement. As I said in the first sentence, it&#8217;s super easy to look at a chart and pick out the buy and sell points. You can write code to test specific buy and sell signals (backtesting) but <em>you can&#8217;t backtest your brain.</em> You can&#8217;t write code to test all the types of reactions and emotional responses when you have money on the line.</p>

<p>In the next few posts I&#8217;m going to write how I&#8217;ve constructed my charts and what I&#8217;ve done to be scientific about how I view the market and take trades in the pursuit of trading within a trend.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Every market day, I receive an email from <a href="http://www.barchart.com">barchart.com</a> with their chart of the day. It features a stock making a new high, which by definition, is a stock in a upward trend of course. In the introductory paragraph of the email, it said:</p>

<blockquote><p>The &#8220;Chart of the Day&#8221; is ResMed (RMD), which showed up on Tuesday&#8217;s Barchart &#8220;All-Time High&#8221; list. ResMed on Tuesday posted a new all-time high of $43.48 and closed +1.07%. TrendSpotter has been long since Dec 11 at $42.08. In recent news on the stock, ResMed on Oct 25 reported fiscal Q1 EPS of 49 cents, above the consensus of 46 cents. ResMed, with a market cap of $6 billion, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating and diagnosing sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disordered breathing includes sleep apnea and related respiratory conditions.</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought, &#8220;hey, I know this company, they make the CPAP machine I use.&#8221; Back in late 2007, I complained to my doctor about a variety of symptoms and he indicated that a sleep study was a wise course of action. I went to a sleep center, got hooked up to a bunch of sensors and had an awful night&#8217;s sleep. Upon leaving, I saw my technician who said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be seeing you back soon Mr. Robbins!&#8221; Sure enough, I was called back for a follow-up night to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure">CPAP machine</a> and again hooked up to the sensors to measure for improvement. Boy did I have a great night sleep using the machine - sure I bit uncomfortable not being used to wearing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Full_face_cpap_mask.jpg">jet fighter looking mask</a> but I wanted to take the machine home with me! I met with the sleep doctor soon after to find out my results. Without the CPAP machine, I suffered from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea">sleep apnea</a> and averaged an apnea event every other minute. The doctor said that was like someone taping my shoulder that frequently, so of course I wasn&#8217;t sleeping well. Of more serious concern with sleep apnea, is pauses in breathing, which caused, In my case, my oxygen saturation to drop dangerously close to the level that can induce a cardiac event. (Note: see your doctor if you think you might be at risk - this is serious stuff).</p>

<p>So to wrap up my story, in January 2008, I received my CPAP unit and having been using it ever since. I travel with it and I even take a battery pack when camping. Remember, <a href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/knowledge-center/infographic/sleep-more-be-awesome">sleep is awesome!</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lynch">Peter Lynch?</a> Right, back to that. So he wrote a book after his time at the helm of the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund, called &#8220;One up on Wall Street.&#8221; In a nutshell, a major premise is that individuals can do better than Wall Street by investing in companies they experience around them. New store opening up that you like? Stayed at a hotel you really enjoyed? Bought a great device? etc&#8230; These are opportunities to invest in companies that may be growing, but under the radar of financial analysts and traders.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the weekly chart of ResMed <a href="http://stocktwits.com/symbol/RMD">$RMD</a> since January 2008 when I first became aware of the company. Certainly the stock has done well in the 4 years overall but there were two prime trends that offered the most opportunity. See my notes in the chart. Furthermore, nice quarterly earnings growth too: <a href="http://ycharts.com/companies/RMD/eps_growth">Ycharts</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write a post in the near future about this in the near future, but remember this: <em>you can&#8217;t backtest your brain.</em> Anybody can look at a historical chart and point out the best buy and sell points (as I did here) but that doesn&#8217;t make you money. It&#8217;s how you respond to the current chart situation and overall environment and manage the trade that does. I could have thought in 2008, &#8220;interesting company, their product really helps me, I wonder if they&#8217;re publicly traded?&#8221; That would have been my Peter Lynch moment for this stock. Sure, the right time to buy wasn&#8217;t until almost 18 months afterwards but it all starts with the idea.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h4><em>Or, How a non-hacker set-up a &#8220;blogging framework for hackers&#8221;</em></h4>

<p>In starting this site, I had a few objectives besides posting about the markets. I got my first internet account in 1995, and it came with a whopping one megabyte of &#8220;personal web space.&#8221; I thought about what to do with that, as I wanted to learn how to make a web page but didn&#8217;t know what to put on it. My roommate at the time, suggested, &#8220;How about your margarita recipe?&#8221; Bingo, that was it. I learned how to code html and put up my website, titled, &#8220;Spike&#8217;s World Famous Margaritas&#8221; and to borrow the term, I built it and people came, mostly through the Yahoo directory of the time, and by people sharing links. I had a guestbook on the site, coded in Perl and would get several entries a week, which was awesome. The url was ugly, like http://www.deltanet.com/~users/spike/margarita.htm as it was provided by the internet provider. 5 years later in 2000, I finally made a permanent home for my site at <a href="http://www.blenderking.com">blenderking.com</a>. The switchover was part of a project to teach myself Cold Fusion, and I loved what I learned about creating a database driven website, but that will be another post. I later switched to Wordpress after kids sucked up my coding time.</p>

<p>For this new website, my objectives were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn more about cloud computing, using Amazon Web Services and EC2 as a reference point</li>
<li>Learn more about the command line and working with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
<li>I wanted another avenue for writing</li>
<li>Get back into learning programming, modifying code, as well as learn <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a></li>
<li>Create a separate website for market oriented postings</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I found <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> to be exactly what I wanted. I first encountered via <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s site</a>. The default design is great, and as I learned more, I was intrigued by the prospect of creating my own site based on it.</p>

<h4>Why I went with Amazon EC2, with a dash of Dropbox mixed in</h4>
